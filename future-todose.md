8. In home page, load currency sign as per preference
9. Add presets in date range picker
10. Lowercase before saving to db
11. Don't display full name if too long
12. Implement Debounce

14. Handle no data in charts
15. Add infinite scroll for transactions
16. Add icons, like in login page
17. Metadata for each page
